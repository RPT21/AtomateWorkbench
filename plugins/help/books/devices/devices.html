<p>
"Device" refers to the software representation of hardware.  The device driver links a real piece of hardware to a device in the recipe.  In general, a device is a general representation and can be linked to a number of different hardware drivers.  The user must configure each device to reflect the real piece of hardware. To add a device to an existing recipe, choose <b>Recipe &gt; Recipe Options</b>.  In the window "Recipe Options", click the <b>Add</b> button.  Choose a device from the list in the window "Add Device".  The choice will appear in the "Recipe Options" window.  Double click on the new device or select it and click the <b>Edit</b> button.  All devices will be pre-configured to the corresponding hardware included in each Atomate system.

The window "Device Editor" is used to modify devices.  Under <i>User Interface</i>, the user must specify a name which will appear in the column header of the recipe, like channel number or gas type for each MFC, or furnace for the heating element.  The subsequent section, different for each device, has the list <i>Hardware</i>, which gives the user options as to which piece of hardware the device will link.

Device configurations are specific to the recipe for which they were created.  Changing these configurations affects only that recipe.
</p>
<p>
Devices may be added to the recipe without specifying a piece of hardware for them; however, the recipe cannot be executed.
