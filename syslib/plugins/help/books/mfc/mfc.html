Choose <b>Recipe &gt; Recipe Options</b> and click <b>Add</b>.  An "MFC" appears in the type column of the list.  Double click this type or select it and click <b>Edit</b>.  The device editor window appears.
</p>
<p>
<p>
The User Interface panel contains:
<ul>
	<li>Label: the user-defined device name</li>
	<li>Grid Editor Field: determines what the entered value means
		<ul>
			<li>Raw Setpoint (radio button): the nitrogen equivalent flow</li>
			<li>GCF Converted Setpoint (radio button): the real gas flow (need to set the GCF)</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The hardware panel contains:
<ul>
	<li>Gas Conversion Factor: coefficient needed to obtain the real gas flow of each specific gas</li>
	<li>Purge Setpoint: gas flow setpoint after recipe ends or is aborted</li>
	<li>Purge Duration: duration of purge after recipe ends or is aborted</li>
	<li>Hardware: the hardware to which this device is linked (need to have the driver) MKS 647B/C or 146C</li>
	<li>Channel: MFC number, which port it is hooked into on MKS controller 1-8 channel for 647 and 1-4 channel for 146</li>
	<li>Units: units used to read flow value (sccm, slm, etc.)</li>
	<li>Range: maximum value that can be achieved for each MFC specified on hardware</li>
</ul>
