<h1>Adding Users</h1>
<p>
The Workbench supports multiple users through the use of the Operating System's (OS) own user management mechanism.  The procedure for adding and removing users varies for each OS.  Please consult the appropriate section.

<h3>Tips For Linux</h2>
<p>
The Workbench uses the "atomate" group to provide a shared directory for users.  Make sure new users are added to the "atomate" group.
</p>
<p>
If the "atomate" group does not appear on the "Groups" tab of the "Users and Groups" window, simply add a new group called "atomate".  
</p>
<p>
Deletion of the "atomate" group may occur when you remove a user.

	<ol>
		<li>Go to the Start Menu and select Settings &gt; Control Panel</li>

		<li>Make sure that the user has administrator privileges or that the directory "C:\Documents and Users\All  Users\Application Data\AtomateWorkbench" has read and write privileges for all users.  If either one of these options is not used, the new user will be unable to run the Workbench.</li>
